The infectious father of wolves cannot infect a person protected by the Savior because he can only infect a person devoured by werewolves first. The Savior has the right to protect himself. He is not allowed to protect the same person two nights in a row, but the same person is allowed multiple times during the game.</string>

    <string name="wolf_description">This is the basic werewolf of the game. Every night the simple werewolves are awakened by the ringleader so that they agree to choose the villager they will devour. The simple werewolf cannot devour one of his fellows during the night, but may well vote against him in the vote of the day. A werewolf in love cannot vote against his lover if he is a villager. If the werewolves do not unanimously agree on which villager to devour, the feast is canceled by the leader. His goal is to devour all the villagers to win the game. He must absolutely pretend to be a villager during the day phase so as not to be unmasked and then executed by the village during the day phase.</string>

Once the victim is chosen, the ringleader wakes up the evil father of wolves and asks him if he wants to "infect" the victim or not. If the evil father of wolves wishes to infect the victim, the latter does not die devoured but the infection transforms them into a werewolf immediately! If the infected player is a character with powers, his powers remain unchanged, except that from now on he will use them for the benefit of werewolves. The Foul Father of Wolves can only use his infect power once in the game, he can use it on any night he chooses, if at all. If the wicked father of wolves dies before he has used his infectious power, the infectious power is lost.</string>

She can use each potion only once throughout the game. She may well not use her potions overnight. She can very well use only one potion overnight, or use both the same night if she wishes.
